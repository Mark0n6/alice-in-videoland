                    <p>Down, down, down she fell. Would it never come to an end? She began to wonder how many miles she’d fallen and whether she’d end up at the center of the Earth&mdash;or come out the other side!</p>

                    <p>Before she could worry too much, her eyes grew heavy and she began to nod off whispering, “Do cats eat bats?” to no one in particular.
